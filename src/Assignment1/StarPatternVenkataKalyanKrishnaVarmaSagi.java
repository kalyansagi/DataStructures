package Assignment1;/*
Programming #1 (10 points)
Write your Java program named StarPatternYourName as follows. The main method prompts the user to enter a number of rows. Then passes the input string to method printStars(â€¦) to recursively print the pyramid stars. You can use recursive helper method if you need it.
Please carefully think about the number of spaces and stars. There is a space between stars.

Format the outputs as follows. Not only for 20, your program should run correctly with the other integers.
